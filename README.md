# miniMeAPI
This is a mini example of social network REST interface using ExpressJS and MongoDB .

TO-DO & ISSUES

Callback hell.
Request users data & about via GET.
Form Validation.
About is alpha-numeric temporarily.
change methods to POST (using GET for easy testing in browser for now)


** config file uses my free monogodb service for testing purpose.
