# miniMeAPI
This is a mini example of social network REST interface using ExpressJS and MongoDB .
- Data in JSON format
- Use of encryption to store passwords.
- Use of secure token to for user authentication.

TO-DO & ISSUES

- Callback hell.
- Request users data & about via GET.
- Form Validation.
- About is alpha-numeric temporarily.
- change methods to POST (using GET for easy testing in browser for now)
- Implement front end.


** config file uses my free monogodb service for testing purpose.
